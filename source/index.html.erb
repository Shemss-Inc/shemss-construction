        Hard to believe, but from the day we start the construction process, it
        may be as little as 6 months before you can move into your very own
        Shemss home. Shemss homes are not just any ordinary homes, they’re
        <a href="#built-to-last">Built to Last</a>,
        <a href="#built-to-evolve">Built to Evolve</a>, and
        <a href="#built-to-design">Built to Design</a>.
        Your new home comes bundled with the most unique features and advanced
        infrastructure systems ever built.

          Simply put, we build homes that stand the test of time. In all stages
          of the Shemss construction process &mdash; from initial design and
          material selection to the final build &mdash; we opt with selections
          that spell longevity. Your time is valuable and for most people house
          maintenance isn’t exactly the greatest example of having fun. Our
          well-built homes cost less to maintain and stand strong to protect
          your investment.

          <p>
            Just as you grow and change, so too should your house. A Shemss home
            is built with flexibility in mind. With an eye towards the future,
            we’ve put in place an infrastructure that makes maintenance a cinch
            and upgrades a breeze. The future maybe “Smart” but a Shemss home is
            built smarter.

        Selecting a lot is an exciting and potentially daunting first step in
        the construction process. With decades of experience in new builds,
        Shemss is well versed in the intricacies of site selection. We will make
        sure that your new home finds its perfect footing. Our extended network
        includes realtors, surveyors, and specialists who are key assets to our

      <p>
        Step two is where the fun really begins, the designing of your dream
        home. We offer several base designs that are fully customizable to
        create a unique space that fits your lifestyle and expresses who you
        are. Our clients can choose to be as “hands on” or as “hands off” as
        they wish. Our process is tailored to be streamlined, innovative, and
        fun.

        (state and local) inspections translate to a painless build with minimal

        <h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
        <p>
          Your custom completed home is now a blank canvas awaiting your
          personal stamp, a finishing touch. Whether you’re looking to create a
          serene and restful bedroom or dynamic energizing workspace, the
          careful selection and placement of fabrics, furniture, and art is a
          crowning stroke on your masterpiece. If color wheels, feng-shui, and
          shopping are not your strong suit we are happy to connect you with an
          interior designer, vendor, or installer from our extended team to ease
          the process.
