description: >
  “Staying home tonight” will be your new favorite thing. This home is at one
  with Tahoe’s nature, where you’ll appreciate seamless transition into the
  outdoors from your living room. “Who’s coming over?”

  From its modern exterior, Shimizu will invite you in. Cedar lap siding, metal
  accents, concrete accent wall, and a see-through fireplace create a
  modern-rustic appeal. The interior is crafted with the highest quality
  materials: German kitchen cabinets, quartz countertops, Miele appliances, and
  a walk-in pantry create a kitchen for the discerning homeowner. You’ll fall in
  love with the open-concept living, complete with a four-panel sliding door to
  open the space between your living area and deck. The one bed, one bath ADU
  unit above the garage creates a much-desired separate space for a studio,
  guests, or an older child. Come home and relax in Shimizu. We don’t build
  houses, we build homes.
