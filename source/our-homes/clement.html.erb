  A sense of space with the mountain modern atmosphere in mind. When you’re
  home, you need to feel at home. As we design, we sit in your shoes, to bring
  you to that place where you can relax. Open space design gives us an open
  mind, a place to wonder. We give you Tahoe.

  Clement is a touch of modern, custom design by SHEMSS. With 2,680 sq. feet
  living areas and flow out to a relaxing back deck, this is Tahoe living at its
  finest. The open kitchen and unique lighting and plumbing fixtures add
  elegance to modern design. You’ll enjoy the secluded master suite, with its
  high ceilings and large windows. This is a home built for Tahoe and crafted
  for style and comfort in all seasons.
