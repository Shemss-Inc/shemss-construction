description: >
  A Mountain Modern home that is rich with windows and a well thought out floor
  plan. Dressed in Natural Stone, Metal Panels, Decorative beams, a Metal Roof
  and Siding. You would be walking in through a Mahogany front door and stepping
  onto Hardwood Floors. The ceilings are finished with alder wood.

  The quality craftsmanship continues into the kitchen with cabinetry from
  Europe. For an appealing modern setting, the kitchen appliances are
  conveniently integrated into the cabinets. Once you are done cooking up a
  storm in the kitchen, enjoy your meal in a Great Room with a fireplace and
  balcony. The family room is full of entertainment which leads outside onto the
  backyard deck. Enjoy a glass of champaign on your own master suite balcony
  watching the fire in the double-sided fireplace or taking a bath in a
  free-standing bathtub sipping your favorite drink as it snows outside.
  We don’t build houses, we build homes.
