  Our Mountain Modern designs capture the spirit of mountain architecture, which
  results in truly unique homes for our clients. SHEMSS has been designing
  modern homes with open concept spaces for their clients, and the SHEMSS models
  also feature open concept design.

  Open concept interior design is all around highly desired in residential
  homes. The floor-to-ceiling window fronts provide the living area with plenty
  of daylight and a very modern fireplace which creates irresistible coziness
  and warmth. Kitchen Island, decor, and even countertops, hardware, and kitchen
  appliances. Values that can be discovered behind each door drawer of their
  kitchens. We don’t build houses, we build homes.
