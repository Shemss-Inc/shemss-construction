description: >
  As it should be, coming home is a vacation. A space that helps you dream, and
  your mind to wander. Your surroundings are like being up on the mountain, but
  you are just upstairs with its beautiful, colossal windows. As we like to say,
  we don’t have any windows, only frames of Tahoe.

  Enjoy the quiet setting of this Modern Home with touches of wood, metal, and
  natural stones. Have a cup of coffee or a glass of wine on the large front
  balcony. This Home features Italian hardwood floors, alder wood ceilings and
  natural stone double-sided fireplaces. Large windows in every room of the home
  give great views, and plenty of natural light. The Master Suite has a walk-in
  closet and a freestanding tub. Custom lighting and plumbing fixtures
  throughout the house add to a modern mountain design.
