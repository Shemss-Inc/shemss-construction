  A mountain-modern getaway where nature is just a breath away and the mountains
  call from your front door. Take in a relaxing evening from your deck or sip
  hot cocoa and relax under the wood vaulted ceilings. A home to dream in.

  Tavor is a mountain modern, smaller footprint design featuring a coveted
  Tahoe garage space. Its flat roof and cedar lap siding accents are at one with
  nature, while outdoor living awaits from the front and side decks. Enjoy your
  morning coffee, straight from the Master Suite to the deck and soak in the
  fresh mountain air. An open floor concept with a Great Room features large
  windows for sweeping outdoor views. Quality craftsmanship continues into the
  kitchen, where European cabinetry and hidden kitchen appliances create an
  appealing, modern setting. Come home to Tavor, your place to relax.
