  Our Gardner Mountain model was inspired by the rustic-chic lifestyle so many
  enjoy here in California. It features large entertaining space and an open
  floor plan. Expansive views from the home open to the outdoors.

  Our Gardner model is generous with windows revealing Tahoe’s outdoor beauty
  and spilling in its natural light. The great room is inviting with high
  ceilings, adorned with wooden beams. The beautiful fireplace and stylish
  kitchen make it a pleasure to entertain. This model is rich with interior wood
  accent walls and features a secluded master suite with a high ceiling and
  walk-in closets. Wind-down at the upstairs family room, equipped with its own
  fireplace and a balcony looking out to a large front yard with a sunset view.
  Toast the day as you sit next to the built-in fire pit. The Gardner model is
  built for comfort and peace; it’s home.
