  is well thought out for comfortable living with an open space concept. It’s a
  4 bedroom, 3 bathroom home, with a garage.

  This home features German kitchen cabinets and a large island with quartz
  countertops. Built-in Appliances by Miele, including a refrigerator, steam
  oven, and coffee maker are state-of-the-art. Going up the stairway you are
  greeted with a beautiful light fixture and then the room opens up. This modern
  Great room features a fireplace that can be enjoyed and a balcony. We don’t
  build houses, we build homes.
