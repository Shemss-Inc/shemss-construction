  We reveal what’s trending in textures, finishes, details, fixtures, materials,
  vanity, accessories, styles, and ideas to beautify your space. The floor plan
  is well thought out for comfortable living with an open space concept. It’s a
  4 bedroom, 3 bathroom home, with a garage.

  This home features German kitchen cabinets and a large island with quartz
  countertops. Built-in Appliances by Miele, including a refrigerator, steam
  oven, and coffee maker are state-of-the-art. Going up the stairway you are
  greeted with a beautiful light fixture and then the room opens up. This modern
  Great room features a fireplace that can be enjoyed and a balcony. We don’t
  build houses, we build homes.
