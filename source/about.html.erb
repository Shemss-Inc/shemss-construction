          <p>
            In order to succeed in the construction industry, a general
            contractor must possess not only the requisite skills of the trade
            but also a relentless drive, a heaping dose of experience, and a
            heartfelt commitment to the complete satisfaction of the client.
          </p>
          <p>
            We work hard because we have a passion for construction and truly
            love what we do. Shemss is a close-knit team and we thrive on the
            camaraderie weâ€™ve built over the years. We believe our success stems
            from our cohesion as a team and the joy we find in our work. The
            icing on the cake is the thrill and wonder of our clients as they
            receive the keys to their new home.
          </p>
